# A Rustic invitation to parsing: Calculator demo
This is the code repository that accompanies the [Rustic invitation to parsing](https://www.equalto.com/blog/a-rustic-invitation-to-parsing) blog post.
It provides a simple "desk calcualtor", showing how to build a handmade parser in Rust.

To run the calculator:

```bash
$ cargo run
```

To confirm that the calculator is working as expected, provide the input `1+2` and you should receive the output `3`:

```
Input: 1+2
Output: 3
```

## Test

```bash
$ cargo test
```
